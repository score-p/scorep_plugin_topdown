# Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis Method Score-P Plugin
This plugin adds [Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis Method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6844459) (TMAM) support into Score-P traces.

Note that it only supports cores using the Golden Cove microarchitecture (at least Alder Lake P-cores/Sapphire Rapids CPUs).
